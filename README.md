# Terminal Hangman Game in Python

I created this simple terminal-based Hangman game in Python for my cousin, but feel free to enjoy it as you want! Test your word-guessing skills and have fun!

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rutwij-Patil/hangman.git

## Execution:
1. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd hangman
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can check your Python version
using the following command:
    ```bash
    python --version
3. Run the game by executing the 'hangman. py' script:
    ```bash 
    python hangman.py
4. The game will start, and you'll be presented with an underscored word, representing the
secret word to guess, along with the number of attempts you have.

5. Guess letters one by one by entering a letter and pressing Enter. If the letter is in the secret
word, it will be revealed; if not, your remaining attempts will decrease.

6. Keep guessing letters until you either solve the word or run out of attempts. If you solve the
word, you win the game; if not, you lose.

7. After the game ends, you'll have to start from step 3. to play again or exit.

## Features
• Randomly selected words to keep the game challenging and fun.

• User-friendly terminal interface.

## Customization
You can customize this game by modifying the word list in the 'hangman-py' file. Update the
'word_list' variable with your own list of words to make the game more interesting.
